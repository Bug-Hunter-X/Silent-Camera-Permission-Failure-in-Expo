# Silent Camera Permission Failure in Expo

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Expo projects where camera permission requests can fail silently. The `Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync()` function might not provide clear feedback when permission is denied, leaving developers puzzled.

## Problem

The provided code snippet shows a typical implementation of requesting camera permissions using Expo's Camera API. However, if the user denies permission, the application won't display any error message or indication, resulting in a seemingly non-functional camera.

## Solution

The solution involves more robust error handling to catch potential issues during the permission request.  We also provide better user feedback on permission status.
